# Midterm Reflection – COMP 170 SU25
Reflecting on the first half of this course, I’m pleased with my consistency and engagement. I’ve submitted every assignment on time, followed all the course rules, and made it a point to be punctual and present during class sessions. I actively participate, ask questions when I need clarification, and do my best to contribute to the learning environment.
There was one instance when I missed a class transition to Zoom because I didn’t check my email in time. It was an honest oversight, and I’ve made it a priority since then to stay more alert to announcements and check my messages regularly. Aside from that, I’ve maintained steady attendance and a strong commitment to the course.
While I don’t intend to become a full-time programmer, I’ve put in extra effort outside of class to build my understanding of Python. My goal is to work in IT project management, and I believe having a hands-on grasp of programming will allow me to collaborate better with technical teams. I want to be able to follow what’s happening behind the code—not to write it all myself, but to lead projects confidently and communicate with developers effectively.
This course has helped me approach learning with intention, and I appreciate the ungrading model that emphasizes growth. In the second half, I’ll continue studying beyond class time, reviewing concepts I find challenging, and building practical confidence in Python.
