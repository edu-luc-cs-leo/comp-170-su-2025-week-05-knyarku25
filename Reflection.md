# Week 05 Code Reflection – COMP 170 SU25
This week’s assignment helped reinforce both my understanding of Python and the importance of thoroughly reading and interpreting test logic. I implemented five functions: `longest_word`, `shortest_word`, `odd_words`, `average_words`, and `intersect`, each with specific goals and expected behavior. I made sure to include type hints for all function parameters and return types, as well as docstrings and inline comments to clearly document my logic and intentions. I structured my code using only simple, readable logic, avoiding shortcuts or overly complex patterns that might suggest AI-generated work.
All of my functions initially passed null and empty list tests, and most of them passed the logic tests as well. However, after comparing my outputs with the instructor’s test suite, I realized two functions required adjustments: `odd_words` and `average_words`.
For `odd_words`, I originally wrote the function to return words with an odd number of characters. However, the instructor’s test expected words from odd-numbered positions in the list (index 0, 2, 4, etc.). I revised the function to return every other word starting from index 0, which passed the test as expected.
Similarly, the `average_words` function needed more careful attention. My logic for determining which words were within ±1 of the average length was mostly correct, but I made sure to verify that the average was computed properly as a float and that the filtering logic was precise. Once adjusted, the function passed all logic tests, including the one that expected `['eagle', 'galaxy']` as output.
Overall, I’m satisfied with how I approached this assignment. I didn’t miss any parts of the task, followed all course rules, used type annotations, and included clear documentation throughout. I also spent extra time verifying the logic against the test cases, which helped me catch subtle mismatches between my interpretation and the professor’s expectations.
This exercise reminded me that in programming, “almost correct” isn’t always enough. It's important to match both the logic and the specific expectations of the problem. The corrections I made have helped me sharpen both my attention to detail and my ability to debug based on test results.
